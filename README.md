# About The Project

The following algorithms were implemented:

*Assignment 1)*
Contours search using the Suzuki algorithm (Suzuki S. et al. Topological structural analysis of digitized binary images by border);

2) Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization Algorithm (CLAHE), 

from paper: Pizer S. M. et al. Adaptive histogram equalization and its variations;

3) Otsu and Sauvola binarization algorithms;

4) Digital Image Forgery Detection Using JPEG Features and Local Noise Discrepancies [https://www.hindawi.com/journals/tswj/2014/230425/];

5) Canny Edge search algorithm, Two Pass Connected Components Labeling;

6) Algorithm for finding the “correct” text orientation using the Fourier transform for images;
